    "2. 'A': 2.2 represents the frontal area of the vehicle in square meters (m^2).\n",
    "3. 'Crr': 0.01 stands for the coefficient of rolling resistance, which is a dimensionless quantity that represents the resistance to motion of the vehicle due to friction between the tires and the road surface.\n",
    "4. 'm': 1500 represents the mass of the vehicle in kilograms (kg).\n",
    "5. 'g': 9.81 represents the acceleration due to gravity in meters per second squared (m/s^2).\n",
    "6. 'rho': 1.225 represents the density of air in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m^3).\n",
    "7. 'lambda_': 0.80 is a coefficient related to the efficiency of the vehicle's powertrain.\n",
    "8. 'alpha': 0.25 is a coefficient related to the road gradient or slope.\n"
